# Raspberry Pi to Arduino Data Logger Project

## Overview

This GitHub project aims to create a data logging system using a Raspberry Pi, an Arduino, and various sensors. The goal is to establish a wired connection between your device and a Raspberry Pi, which will then communicate with an Arduino over a Wi-Fi network using TCP/IP sockets. The Arduino, equipped with humidity and temperature sensors, will collect data and send it back to the Raspberry Pi via socket communication.

## Features

- Connect your device to a Raspberry Pi via a wired connection.
- Establish a wireless connection between the Raspberry Pi and an Arduino over Wi-Fi.
- Utilize TCP/IP sockets for communication between the Raspberry Pi and Arduino.
- Monitor humidity and temperature using sensors attached to the Arduino.
- Log and record sensor data on the Raspberry Pi.
- Easily customize and expand the project for additional sensors or functionality.

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions in the project's documentation to set up your Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and sensors. This may include hardware connections, software installation, and configuration.

## Usage

1. Connect your device to the Raspberry Pi using the provided cable.
2. Ensure both the Raspberry Pi and Arduino are powered on and connected to the same Wi-Fi network.
3. Run the project's software on the Raspberry Pi to establish a socket connection with the Arduino.
4. Send commands from the Raspberry Pi to the Arduino to initiate data logging.
5. The Arduino will collect humidity and temperature data from the sensors and send it back to the Raspberry Pi.
6. Data will be logged and can be accessed or analyzed as needed.
